FIRST TEST MODEL

The dataframe was not manipulated a lot e.g. languages have not been grouped, keywords have not been extracted.

first model created without normalization, scaling, removing outliers, dealing with imbalanced data.
used a simple logistic regression model.

result
60,89% correct classifications to successful and failed
58,30% of successful projects are predicted correctly
BUT 38,51% of failed projects are predicted incorrectly
